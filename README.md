# kotlinconf2019

Complete source code for the demos of my KotlinConf 2019 presentation - Implementing the Gradle Kotlin DSL 

To run the Turtle Graphics demo plugin:

    cd turtle
    ./gradlew :turtle-plugin:runIde
    
Then open the `samples/turtle-sample` project in the spawned IDE instance, open the _Turtle Preview_ tool window (_CMD-SHIFT-A_) and have fun!
